# Contributing to LabFox

Thanks for your interest in contributing. LabFox supports four platforms from **a single Flutter codebase**.
A bug you fix on desktop is fixed on mobile too — every contribution reaches every platform.

---

## Project model

```
Source code            Apache-2.0 open source — anyone may use, modify, redistribute
Desktop (Win/macOS)    Free
Mobile (Android/iOS)   Sold on the App Store / Play Store
```

Code you contribute is published under Apache-2.0 and **will also ship in the paid mobile apps.**
Make sure you understand and accept that before contributing. If you don't, please don't contribute.

The "LabFox" name and logo are trademarks and are not covered by the Apache-2.0 license.
Fork freely, but use a different name and icon. ([TRADEMARK.md](TRADEMARK.md))

## Before you start

1. **Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first.** It covers the architecture, conventions, and what's off-limits.
   The same rules apply to humans and coding agents alike.
2. Check that what you plan to work on falls inside the **1.0 scope** (AGENTS.md §9).
3. For any large change, discuss it in an issue before writing code.

---

## Development setup

```bash
flutter --version          # 3.38.9, stable channel
flutter pub get            # resolves the whole pub workspace at once
```

The repository is a native pub workspace (Dart 3.6+), not a melos monorepo, so
there is no extra tool to install: one `flutter pub get` at the root resolves
`apps/labfox` and every package against a single lockfile.

```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Workflow

```
Issue → Branch → Commit → Pull Request
```

> LabFox is a GitLab client, but **development happens on GitHub.**
> The domain term inside the app is still Merge Request; only the contribution process uses Pull Request.

Branch from `dev` and target your pull request at `dev`. Nothing is committed directly to `dev` or `main` — `main` holds releases only.

```bash
git switch -c feat/12-mr-diff-viewer dev
```

- Branches: `<type>/<issue-number>-<slug>` — type is one of `feat` `fix` `docs` `refactor` `test` `chore`
- Commits: [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
  e.g. `fix(gitlab_api): handle keyset pagination in project list`
- Link the issue from the PR description with `Closes #12`
- Details: [`.agents/docs/workflow.md`](.agents/docs/workflow.md)

### Before you open a PR

```bash
dart format .
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Don't open a PR while `analyze` warnings remain.

## Ground rules

### License

- **Never pull in GPL, LGPL, or AGPL code.** Once copyleft spreads, the entire project becomes GPL,
  which voids Apache-2.0 and blocks App Store distribution.
- New dependencies are limited to **MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0, ISC, and Zlib**.
  If you add one, update [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md).
- Don't copy code from other projects. Read them for reference all you like, but write the implementation yourself.
- Check fonts, icons, and images for commercial-use rights as well.

### Platform

- **Don't build a separate UI per platform.** Branch on screen width instead:
  use `LayoutBuilder` plus breakpoints, not `Platform.isAndroid`.
  This is exactly why a desktop contribution carries over to mobile.
- Even for a desktop-only fix, verify that nothing breaks at mobile width (<600).

### Security

- Never leave tokens (PAT / OAuth) in logs, code, screenshots, or commits.
- When attaching logs to an issue or PR, scrub `Authorization` headers and any `glpat-` strings.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Include a `Signed-off-by` line in every commit.

```bash
git commit -s -m "fix(gitlab_api): handle keyset pagination"
```

This signals your agreement to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
and confirms that **you have the right to contribute the code.**
There is no separate CLA to sign.

## Review

- Keep PRs small enough to review. Anything over 1,000 lines gets a look at whether it can be split.
- Attach screenshots for UI changes — **both mobile and desktop**, both light and dark.
- CI must pass before anything is merged.
- Reviews may take a while; thanks for your patience.

## Good places to start

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bug reports** | Most useful when the reproduction steps are clear |
| **Self-hosted issues** | Problems on different GitLab versions and configurations are hard for us to reproduce |
| **Desktop UX** | Windows/macOS feel, keyboard shortcuts, multi-pane layouts |
| **Accessibility** | Screen readers, contrast, touch targets |
| **Translation** | Multi-language support |

## What we won't accept

- Features outside the 1.0 scope (Wiki, Packages, Registry, Analytics, Admin, and so on)
- UI built with GitHub brand assets
- Changes that bypass the architecture (calling `GitLabClient` directly from a widget, for example)
