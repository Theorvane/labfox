# GitLab mobile-web parity tracker

This is the working inventory for the maintainer-approved expansion beyond the
original 1.0 scope. It is **not** a claim that LabFox matches every GitLab web
screen. GitLab behavior varies by version, tier, role, project settings, and
feature flags. A route or API method proves only the named slice, not a whole
feature area.

Baseline: `dev` at `aa447ad` (2026-09-27). The [roadmap](../.agents/docs/roadmap.md)
records the original scope; `AGENTS.md` §9 records the expansion. Use GitLab's
[project feature catalog](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/organize_work_with_projects/),
[project settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/settings/), and
[permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/permissions/) to discover and verify
work, not as a fixed denominator.

## Progress accounting

- **Shipped baseline** below means the named app slice is on `dev`. It does not
  mean the entire GitLab feature area is complete.
- **Known work packages** are broader than PRs. Split each package into
  issue-sized slices before coding; add more packages as gaps are discovered.
- Status moves `Queued → In progress → In review → Shipped`. `Shipped` requires
  tests, review approval, passing CI, and merge into `dev`. Use `Blocked` with
  a reason when tier, permission, API, or design constraints prevent progress.
- Update the snapshot, evidence, and issue/PR links in the same PR that changes
  a row. Do not calculate a GitLab parity percentage from this incomplete list.

Snapshot (2026-09-27): **18 known work packages**, **1 shipped**, **1 in
progress**, **16 queued**. This is a lower bound on remaining work,
**not 18 PRs** or an ETA. The shipped baseline is excluded from that count.

## Known work packages

`P0` preserves the developer workflow; `P1` completes adjacent mobile-web
tasks; `P2` covers broad administrative surfaces. A package can need several
issues and PRs. Keep it open until its full acceptance boundary is verified.

| ID | Priority | Work package and acceptance boundary | Status | Tracking |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MW-01 | P1 | Group protected environments: list/detail, deploy/approval rules, role/tier errors, narrow/wide tests. | Shipped | [#326](https://github.com/Theorvane/labfox/issues/326), [PR #328](https://github.com/Theorvane/labfox/pull/328) |
| MW-02 | P1 | Project protection-rule creation, update, and removal with permission checks. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-03 | P1 | Project/group settings inventory and authorized general/repository/CI changes. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-04 | P1 | Member invitations, role/expiry changes, and removal for groups/projects. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-05 | P0 | Issue/work-item editing, metadata, types, and validated state transitions. | In progress | [#329](https://github.com/Theorvane/labfox/issues/329) covers title and description editing only; remaining metadata and work-item actions need separate issues. |
| MW-06 | P1 | Boards and iterations: discover mobile-web behavior, then list/detail/mutations. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-07 | P0 | Advanced MR review: audit inline discussions/suggestions and finish missing review/approval flows. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-08 | P1 | CI/CD configuration: pipeline editor, variables, triggers, and schedule editing. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-09 | P1 | Wiki creation/editing/deletion and history with conflict handling. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-10 | P1 | Snippet creation/editing/deletion, files, and visibility. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-11 | P1 | Release and milestone creation/editing/closure/deletion. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-12 | P1 | Package/container management, cleanup, and protection by tier. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-13 | P2 | Security: inventory and implement vulnerability, policy, and scan views by role. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-14 | P2 | Analytics: inventory project/group reports and implement mobile layouts. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-15 | P2 | Infrastructure/Kubernetes: inventory current pages and API capabilities first. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-16 | P2 | Instance/group administration and runner inventory/actions, role-gated. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-17 | P1 | Broader search scopes, filters, and deep-link coverage. | Queued | Issue needed |
| MW-18 | P0 | Cross-cutting comparison by role, tier, self-hosted version, and viewport; record every missing action. | Queued | Issue needed |

## Procedure for the next slice

1. Verify current GitLab documentation and mobile-web behavior. Record tier,
   role, API, and feature-flag requirements in an issue and refine its row here.
2. Use one issue, one branch from `dev`, and one PR into `dev`. Write a failing
   behavior test before implementation. Keep one responsive UI across platforms.
3. Test parsing, pagination, domain errors, empty states, deep links, and narrow
   and wide widths as applicable. Run formatting, analysis, and package/app tests.
4. Link the PR and move the row to `In review`. Move it to `Shipped` only after
   approval, passing CI, and merge. Add discovered gaps as new rows rather than
   silently expanding the definition of done.
